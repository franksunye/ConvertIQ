# Architecture Overview

## Development Philosophy
We follow Agile development principles and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle in our architecture decisions:
- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Evolve the architecture based on real needs
- Avoid premature optimization
- Keep components loosely coupled
- Document only what's necessary

## System Design
[To be documented as the system evolves]

## Components
[To be documented as components are developed]

## Data Flow
[To be documented as data flows are established]

## Technology Stack
[To be documented as technologies are selected]

## Security Considerations
[To be documented as security requirements are identified]

## Performance Considerations
[To be documented as performance requirements are identified]

## Notes
- This document will be updated as the architecture evolves
- Key decisions and their rationale will be documented here
- We maintain simplicity in our architectural choices
- Architecture evolves through continuous feedback and iteration
